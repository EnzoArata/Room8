# Room8

<p>This is a project I started for an app idea I had, the premise is it is for roomates. After living in multiple households I was frustrated at the lack of accountability between roomates. I wanted an easy to way to share the workload ofliving in a house together. I was sick of reminding people to take out the trash or clean out the fridge</p>

## Concept
  
<p>It would allow you to keep track of payments and make payments for utilities and rent. It also would have a system for keeping track and assigning household chores. Each task is assigned to a user and also has an approver who can verify that the task has been completed</p>

## Additional Features

- Account system
  - Each user has an account that would have information about them, such as what type of roommate they are and preferences (Night owl/Morning Person, Clean/Messy, Extrovert/Introvert)
  - Landlord user type for landlords. Can integrate payments into the app if they want. Can review users and can be reviewed by users
- Ability to search for other roommates on the app
- Chores/Jobs
  - Ability to assign recurring or non-recurring tasks to users
  - Can have an overseer, basically someone who can verify that the task is complete (Trash is taken out/living room is vacuumed, etc.)



## Flaws

<p>In its concept, room8 is a rather high maintenance application. Many people simply dont want to live in a clean house or do chores~ however these are only optional but they are some of the good features of the app</p>

## Adoption

<p>Enterprise adoption seems like a very good candidate and also a revenue source. Imaging getting a university to onbaord the app for all incoming freshman, it could be a good way to match roomates together with similar lifestyles. Based on ratings and profiles it could also be a good setup for campus living after freshmen year. Apartments could also use the app for accepting payments and utilities.</p>
